**Unit 4: Plant Ecology** <span id="4"></span> 
*In this final unit, we will learn how plants fit into the global
ecology.  You will discover that every biome has characteristic
vegetation uniquely adapted to the abiotic factors in its environment. 
We will also learn how plants disperse globally, compete within a
community, and facilitate the cycling of resources through an
environment.  Upon completion of this unit, you should be able to
explain how plants are important to ecology and how any one plant fits
within its habitat, ecosystem, and biome.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 9 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.1: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.2: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.3: 3 hours

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Define the major vegetative plant biomes on the planet.
-   Describe the major plant communities in terms of competition for
    resources (sun, water, nutrients and space), niche partitioning, and
    speciation.
-   Define resource cycling.
