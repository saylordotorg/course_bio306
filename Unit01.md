**Unit 1: Plant Anatomy** <span id="1"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn the anatomy of the plant.  Anatomy is
Greek for “a cutting up.”  Plant anatomy, therefore, examines the
**structure** of plant parts, their forms, and how those parts are
organized.  In contrast, plant physiology, which you will study in Unit
2, is from the Greek for “relationship to nature,” and concerns the
**function** of the plant parts.  Anatomy and physiology are
inextricably linked—the structure determines the function, and vice
versa.  Natural selection is an extremely efficient engineer.*  
    
 *Recall from [BIO101](../../courses/bio101a/) and
[BIO102](../../courses/bio102/) the different organization levels of
organisms.  Atoms bond to form molecules, molecules combine to form
organelles, and organelles combine to form cells.  Specialized cells
come together to form tissues that have specialized functions.  Groups
of specialized tissues, in turn, combine to form organs--more complex
structures that carry out more complex processes.  Groups of organs
which function together for one common purpose are called organ
systems.  Multiple organ systems make up the organism; i.e., the
plant.*  
    
 *In this unit, you will learn the anatomy of the plant at the
organelle, cell, tissue, organ, and organ system level.  In Unit 2, you
will turn to the physiology, or functions, of the anatomical structures
you have learned here.  
  
 *In this class, we will focus primarily on the anatomy and physiology
of higher (flowering) plants, or angiosperms.  A more detailed study of
other, more “lower,” plants, such as nonvascular plants (mosses,
liverworts and hornworts), vascular seedless plants (whisk ferns, club
mosses, horsetails, and true ferns), and vascular nonflowering seeded
plants (gymnosperms) are reserved for a higher level Botany course. 
Members of the Kingdoms Fungi (mushrooms) and Protista (algae and
single-celled photosynthetic organisms) are traditionally covered in a
general Botany course.  However, since you have already learned this
material in [BIO102](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio102/), we omit
these Kingdoms here.**

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 15 hours to complete.

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Identify the organelles of a eukaryotic cell.
-   Compare and contrast animal and plant cells.
-   Identify the specialized forms of plant cells.
-   Identify the different tissues that make up the plant.
-   Identify the different organs and organ systems (roots, stems,
    leaves, and flowers) that make up the plant.
