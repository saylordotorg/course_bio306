**Unit 3: Evolution and Taxonomy** <span id="3"></span> 
*Plants have been on earth for almost 500 million years.  (In contrast,
man, or members of the* Homo*genus, originated only 2.5 million years
ago.)  During this long period, plants have evolved and adapted to a
staggering range of environmental conditions to form many different
specialized divisions.  In this unit, we will survey the history and
evolution of plants on earth, with an eye toward understanding how
certain adaptations shaped and enabled plant kingdom’s survival.  We
will also learn how scientists classify plant life and take a broad look
at biodiversity among plants by learning the major characteristics of
plant divisions. *

     Instructions: Read this chapter for an overview of the so-called

    (gymnosperms and angiosperms), in contrast, are referred to as
    “non-primitive plants.”  Be careful not to be confused by the terms
    “the bryophytes” (referring to the nonvascular plants: hornworts,
    liverworts, and mosses) and the Division “Bryophyta” (which is the
