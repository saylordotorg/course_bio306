Botany is the study of plants.  Because species in the plant kingdom
have characteristics that make them distinct from any other form of
life, they are particularly interesting subjects for the study of
evolution and physiology.  For example, whereas most organisms are
dependent on other organisms for energy, plants can capture energy
directly from photons of light and convert it into a usable form through
the process of photosynthesis.  For this reason, plants are referred to
as the “producers” in a habitat.  Unlike the cells of other organisms,
plant cells have rigid cell walls constructed from the inside out
(rather than the outside in) during mitosis and cytokinesis.  Plants
also have a variety of unique reproductive and dispersal mechanisms that
allow them to quickly adapt to, occupy, and invade far-flung areas,
despite their general immobility. In this course, you will learn the
basics of plant biology.  We will begin with plant anatomy, learning the
names and functions of all of the parts of a plant.  We will then move
on to plant physiology, where you will learn about photosynthesis,
growth, and reproduction.  Next, we will study plant evolution according
to the fossil record and will take a general look at the diversity of
plant life in existence today.  Finally, we will discuss the ways in
which plants fit into the global ecology, highlighting their importance
in any habitat. This course will prepare you for further study in the
fields of botany and horticulture.  It will also be useful to students
of ecology, evolution, and resource management.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able
to:  
  

-   Identify and describe the functions of the different cells, tissues,
    and organs that make up a plant.
-   Describe the major life processes in plants (photosynthesis,
    respiration, transpiration, growth and development, and
    reproduction) at the tissue, organ, cellular, and molecular level.
-   Explain the history and evolution of plants on earth.
-   Discuss plant diversity and identify the major characteristics of
    plant phylogenetic divisions. 
-   Explain how plants fit into the global ecological system and why
    they are essential for life on earth.

### Course Information

Welcome to BIO306:  Botany!  Below, please find general information on
this course and its requirements. 

**Course Designer:** [Attorney John W. Rooney,
Ph.D.](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-o-t/#AttorneyJohnWRooney)

**Primary Resources: ** This course is composed of a wide range of
different free, online materials.  However, the course makes primary use
of the following materials:

-   Eastern Connecticut State University: Professor Ross E. Koning’s
    [Plant Physiology Information
    Website](http://plantphys.info/plant_physiology/schedule.shtml)
    (HTML)
-   University of Hamburg: Professor Alice Bergfeld, Rolf Bergmann, and
    Peter v. Sengbusch’s *[Botany Online: The Internet
    Hypertextbook](http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e00/contents.htm)*
    (HTML)
-   Estrella Mountain Community College: Professor Michael J. Farabee’s
    *[On-Line Biology
    Book](http://www2.estrellamountain.edu/faculty/farabee/biobk/biobooktoc.html)*
    (HTML)
-   YouTube: UC Berkeley: Professor Jennifer A. Doudna’s [Biology 1A
    Lectures](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRiokVd-ID8&feature=list_related&playnext=1&list=SP58DC5865AE85BA28)

    (YouTube)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work  
 through each unit and all of its assigned materials.  You will also
need to complete:

-   Subunit 2.1.4 Assessment and Assignments
-   Subunit 2.2 Assessments
-   Subunit 3.2.2 Assessment
-   Subunit 3.2.3 Assessment
-   Subunit 3.2.2.2.1.4 Assessments
-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
 However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the quizzes and problem sets listed above.

In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  

**Time Commitment:**  This course should take you a total of **83.5
hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists
the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These
should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a
look at these time advisories and to determine how much time you have
over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you 14 hours.  Perhaps you
can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete subunit 1.1.1 on
Monday night (2 hours); subunits 1.1.2.1 to 1.1.2.2 on Tuesday night (2
hours); subunits 1.1.2.3 to 1.1.2.4 on Wednesday night (2 hours), etc…

**Tips/Suggestions:** As noted in the “Course Requirements,”
[BIO101](../../courses/bio101/) and [B102](../../courses/bio102/) are
pre-requisites for this course.  If you find yourself struggling with
topics you covered in these courses as you progress through this course,
consider taking a break to revisit [BIO101](../../courses/bio101/) and
[BIO102](../../courses/bio102/).

  

Botany is a rich and diverse subject, and sometimes it is easy to “lose
sight of the forest for the trees.” You may find yourself so focused on
a detailed topic such as, say, hornworts, photosynthesis, or diatoms,
that you lose sight of the big picture.  The lack of a single primary
resource makes this even more likely.  For this reason, I highly
recommend that you outline and take notes as you progress through the
course, and review your outline and notes frequently.  This will be
useful when preparing for your Final Exam.
