**Unit 2: Plant Physiology** <span id="2"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn the basics of plant life: photosynthesis,
respiration, transpiration (water utilization), nutrition, growth and
development, and reproduction.*  
  
 *Recall from B101 that all cells utilize ATP as the universal energy
source or “currency.”  Metabolic reactions are driven using the energy
produced by breaking the terminal phosphate bond of ATP.  The cellular
organelles that produce ATP are the chloroplast (in plant cells) and the
mitochondrion (in plant and animal cells).*  
  
 *The production of ATP in the chloroplast occurs by the process of
photosynthesis and is covered in subunit 2.1.  The production of ATP in
the mitochondrion occurs by the process of respiration and is covered in
subunit 2.2.  In subunit 2.3, you will learn about transpiration, or how
a plant utilizes water.  In subunit 2.4, you will learn about a plant’s
nutritional needs and how it meets them.  In the remaining sections of
this unit, you will learn about the life cycle of plants, which consists
of growth, development, and reproduction.*

**2.1.3.1.1 Carbon Fixation** <span id="2.1.3.1.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading in Subunit 2.1.3.1.  Carbon
Fixation occurs during the first part of the Calvin cycle when carbon,
in the form of CO2, is attached (“fixed”) to the three-carbon molecule,
ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate, by the carboxylase activity of the enzyme
RuBisCO (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase).*

**2.1.3.1.2 Glucose Formation** <span id="2.1.3.1.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading in Subunit 2.1.3.1.  Glucose
formation occurs during the later part of the Calvin cycle, when two
molecules of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate combine to form the six-carbon
molecule, glucose.*

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this chapter on the photorespiration and C3
    carbon fixation.  As its name implies, the enzyme RuBisCO can also
    fix O2.  This process is called Photorespiration.  Many plants,
    especially important agricultural ones like soybeans and wheat,
    significantly reduce the efficiency of Calvin cycle-carbon fixation
    by photorespiration when CO2/O2 ratios are high.  This occurs during
    periods of water stress and heat, when the stomata close, reducing
    amount of available CO2.  No one knows why this seemingly (to us)
    wasteful biochemical process has persisted.

    Koning’s *Plant Physiology Information Website*:  “[C4 and CAM
    Cycles](http://plantphys.info/plant_physiology/c4cam.shtml)”
    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions:  Read this chapter on the C4 and CAM cycles.  These
    are two evolutionary adaptations by plants to avoid
    photorespiration.  C4 plants, usually of tropical origin, fix carbon
    by joining CO2 to a three-carbon compound.   The resulting
    four-carbon compound is then quickly shuttled into specialized
    bundle sheath cells where they are used to form glucose via the
    Calvin cycle.  Plants that fix carbon via the CAM pathway live in
    arid climates, such as deserts.  To conserve water, they open their
    stomata only during the cooler night hours.  However, this prevents
    the normal gas exchange during the day when photosynthesis is
    occurring.  To get around this problem, CAM plants combine CO2 at
    night with a three-carbon compound to form a four-carbon compound,
    which is then stored in leaf vacuoles.  During the day, while
    photosynthesis is occurring and the stomata are closed, CO2 may be
    made available by removing it from the four-carbon compound as
    needed.
